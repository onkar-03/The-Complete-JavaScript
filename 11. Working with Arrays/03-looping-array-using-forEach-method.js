// --- Using ForEach :
// - The forEach method requires a callback function as a parameter
// - So forEach is technically a higher order function
// - The callback function contains the code about what exactly need to be done
// - On each iteration it passes the Element, Index and the Array, we can take only element as well if we want
// - We dont need to write .entries() explicitly to get indexes here
// - Also it will alway loop over the entire array always
// - The 'continue' and 'break' statements don't work here at all

// - Use forEach when we have to iterate over the whole array
